                        | however when I came across a coding challenge from 2017 to recreate the gameplay of Minesweeper in p5, I couldn't resist. I learned a lot about the old syntax
                        | of JS classes, and the bane of OOP in JS (using 'this.' properly), and ultimately the conversion to modern class syntax was virtually painless.

                        | on itself, which used to just result in a game loss.
